# 📉Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning 📈

Welcome to the **Stock Price Prediction** project! This repository demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to analyze and predict stock prices, using Tesla's historical stock data as a case study.

## 📂Project Overview📂

- **Data Source:** The dataset (`Tesla.csv`) contains historical stock prices for Tesla, Inc., including columns for Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close.
- **Notebook:** The main analysis is performed in `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook that walks through data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and predictive modeling.

## 🪶Features 🪶

- 📈 **Data Exploration & Visualization:**
  - Uses `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to explore and visualize trends in Tesla's stock prices.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Implements Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and XGBoost Classifier for stock price prediction.
  - Utilizes `scikit-learn` for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handles missing values, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.
- 📊 **Performance Metrics:**
  - Evaluates models using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
